"""Crux on the Terminus scaffold.

Crux started as a mini-swe-agent derivative, which turned out to be the wrong
base. Measured on the same ten tasks, same model, same deployment:

| harness    | solved |
|------------|--------|
| terminus-2 | 7/10   |
| crux (mini)| 6/10   |
| codex      | 5/9    |

The gap is architectural rather than a matter of tuning. Terminus drives a live
tmux session and sends keystrokes; mini-swe-agent runs one shell command per
turn and reads its stdout. That difference decides whole categories of task --
`qemu-alpine-ssh` needs an interactive ssh session into a VM, which cannot be
expressed as a sequence of one-shot commands at all, and only Terminus solved
it. It also lets one turn issue several keystrokes with individual waits, so
polling a slow build does not cost a model round trip, which is exactly where
this deployment loses tasks: agent timeouts are the largest failure category.

So this subclasses Terminus and adds back the two things worth keeping from
the old agent -- the all-or-nothing scoring instruction, and `crux submit`,
which turns finishing from a judgement into a re-run of every bound check.
Nothing else is changed: the format contract, the tmux handling, and the
summarisation are upstream's, and that is the point.

        Upstream handles truncation by telling the model it exceeded the output
        limit and asking it to "break the request into chunks", then reissuing
        the same call unchanged. That advice assumes the model ran long while
        writing commands. Here it runs long while *thinking*: on puzzle-shaped
        tasks this model produced single turns of 17,000-23,000 completion
        tokens that never reached the `<response>` block at all, so there is
        nothing to chunk and nothing for the salvage path to recover.

        Reissuing under identical conditions then reproduces the spiral. One
        trial spent 17 minutes on such a turn, 29 minutes on the retry, and
        executed zero commands across both -- out of a 3600s budget.

        So the retry drops `enable_thinking`. The model has already done the
        reasoning; what it failed to do is emit a command. Forcing a direct
        answer turns a wasted turn into a cheap one, and the transcript still
        carries the truncated reasoning for the turn after.
